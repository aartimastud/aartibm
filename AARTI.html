			<span id='pp1'>BIRYANI</span>
				<p>Chicken Biryani is a delicious savory rice dish that is loaded 
                    with spicy marinated chicken, caramelized onions, and flavorful saffron rice. For my Biryani,
                    I simplify the order of operations, while retaining the traditional layered approach to 
                    assembling it.
